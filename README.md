# Book: [Writing An Interpeter In Go](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Interpreter-Go-Thorsten-Ball/dp/3982016118)
This repository contains my implementation of an interpreter in C++. I'm following along with the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball, but instead of using Go, I'm translating the code examples into C++ as a learning exercise.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build an interpreter for a simple programming language called "Monkey." The interpreter will be able to parse and evaluate Monkey code, including features like:
- Arithmetic expressions
- Boolean logic
- Variable bindings
- Function definitions and calls
- Built-in functions
- Conditionals and loops
- Hash maps and arrays

By working through the book and translating the Go code into C++, I aim to deepen my understanding of both programming languages and gain practical experience in building an interpreter from scratch.

## Progress
- [x] Chapter 1: Lexing (In Progress)
- [ ] Chapter 2: Parsing
- [ ] Chapter 3: Evaluation
- [ ] Chapter 4: Extending the Interpreter
